# CS204 - Advanced Programming  


This repository contains my **complete homework submissions** for **CS204 - Advanced Programming** at **SabancÄ± University**.  
The course focused on advanced C++ programming concepts including dynamic memory management, data structures, object-oriented programming (OOP), templates, multithreading, exception handling, and (optionally) graphical user interface (GUI) development.  

ðŸ‘‰ All assignments were designed, developed, and debugged using **Xcode** on macOS, demonstrating proficiency with a modern C++ toolchain and IDE.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

This course and repository reflect my ability to:

âœ… Build and manage **dynamic data structures** (linked lists, stacks, queues) using pointers and manual memory management.  
âœ… Design and implement **object-oriented systems** using encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and virtual functions.  
âœ… Write **generic, reusable code** with templated classes and functions.  
âœ… Develop **exception-safe** and **thread-safe** code for robust applications.  
âœ… Utilize **Xcode IDE** for code organization, build management, and debugging.  
âœ… (Where implemented) Explore **bitwise operations** and **macOS GUI programming**.
