# CS204 - Advanced Programming  


This repository contains my **homework submissions** for **CS204 - Advanced Programming** at **SabancÄ± University**.  
The course focused on advanced programming concepts and techniques using **C++**, covering dynamic memory, data structures, templates, object-oriented design, multithreading, and more.  

Each homework demonstrates the application of these concepts through practical implementations, robust designs, and clean, well-documented code.

## ðŸŽ¯ Course Objectives

âœ… Gain mastery of **advanced C++ features**, including pointers, templates, exception handling, and multithreading.  
âœ… Develop efficient, reusable, and maintainable **data structures and algorithms**.  
âœ… Apply **object-oriented design principles** including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.  
âœ… Build solutions with **exception safety** and **thread safety** in mind.  
âœ… (Optional) Explore **graphical user interface (GUI)** development with Visual C++ if time permits.
